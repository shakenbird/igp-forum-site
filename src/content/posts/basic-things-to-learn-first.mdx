## What are the basic things that I need to learn first to know how to create a discord bot professionally?

There are some basic things that you'll need to learn first to create your discord bot professionally. Here is a list of things that you'll need to learn first to create your first professional bot.

<br />

## Website and Docs

You should learn how to read documentation and how to use the guide for the Discord.js package.

<Callout type="info">
  The guide is [here](https://discordjs/guide) and the docs are
  [here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/)
</Callout>

<br />

## Use Google

Google your issue. Don't paste the entire error into Google, though. Google will not know what this is:

```
DiscordAPIError[50006]: Cannot send an empty message
   at SequentialHandler.runRequest (C:\Users\Sussy Amongus\Desktop\Your bot thing\node_modules\@discordjs\rest\dist\index.js:667:15)
   at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
   at async SequentialHandler.queueRequest (C:\Users\Sussy Amongus\Desktop\Your bot thing\node_modules\@discordjs\rest\dist\index.js:464:14)
```

Instead, read or copy and paste the first line of the error into Google.

<br />

## Learn Basic JavaSscript

If you are looking forawrd to make a professional Discord bot you'll need to learn some basic JavaScript. If you want to learn JavaScript or we call it JS for short here are some recommended courses that are free.

<br />

[JavaScript in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE) is a good video to learn the very basics of JavaScript, this video was created by **FireShip** on YouTube.

<br />

### JavaScript Courses

There are many courses about the basics of JavaScript. In my opinion, Codedamn JavaScript course is the best because it tells you what is JavaScript in a video format.

<br />

If you don't like watching videos and want to read paragraphs of text, check out [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

<br />

### Learn Node.js

After learning basic JavaScript, learn Node.js. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ) to learn what Node.js is.
After learning what Node.js is, you can do more in-depth into learning Node.js with [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAUi8pPlcUM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwh8shCMHFA5kWxD9PaPwxaY)

<br />

After you learned all of that stuff you'll have the knowledge to create your own
professional bot. Start by reading about [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/)

<br />

Stuck on your first error? Try to ask the error in [DiscordJS Server](https://discord.gg/djs).

If it is related to DiscodJS, you can ask in the [IGP Coding Villa](https://discord.gg/igp).
