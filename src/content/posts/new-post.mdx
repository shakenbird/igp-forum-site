This post will have information regarding creating a new post on this website.

<br />

There are a few prerequisites to creating posts:

<br />

- You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- Basic knowledge of Markdown and JavaScript.

<br />

## Forking the Repo

A fork is a local copy of the repository that is on your GitHub account, and you can make changes on that repository.

<br />

<button class="bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200 font-bold mb-6 px-4 py-2 rounded-xl inline-flex items-center gap-2 dark:(text-neutral-300 bg-neutral-800 hover:bg-neutral-700)">
  <ClipboardDocumentIcon className="h-6" />
  <p>Click here to fork</p>
</button>

After you make your fork, you can commit changes to that repository. Once you've made the changes you want, [create a pull request](https://github.com/shakenbird/igp-forum-site/pulls) on the main repository.

<br />

## Creating a Post

You can create a post super easily by making a new file in the `src/content/posts` directory.

<br />

For example, you could create the file `hello.md`. Now, you need to fill in the frontmatter of the post. This stores basic data about the post.

```md
---
layout: ../../Layouts/PostLayout.astro # Always use this layout, it's so the post gets properly styled
title: the title of the post
excerpt: a short description about the post
createdAt: the date
author: your name
---

**This is the content of the post.**
```

<br />

## Adding an Author

After creating a post, you may notice this error:

```
posts → new-post.md frontmatter does not match collection schema.
Invalid enum value. Expected 'Duro' | 'JadeBetty' | 'shaken_bird' | 'IHZAQ', received 'somethign'
```

**This means that you have to add yourself as an author.**

<br />

This website uses Astro, which uses Zod for content collections validation.

<br />

This means that you have to add yourself as an author in the `src/util/authors.ts` file. You can do this super easily, just by extending the array.

```ts
// Before:
export const AUTHORS = ["Duro", "shaken_bird"] as const;

// After:
export const AUTHORS = ["Duro", "shaken_bird", "your name"] as const;
```

## Author Image

You can add an image for yourself by uploading an image to the `/public/authors` directory. Please make sure that is it spelt the exact same as your author username in the `src/util/authors.ts` file.

<Callout type="info">Capitalization does not matter for the image file, make it all lower-case.</Callout>
