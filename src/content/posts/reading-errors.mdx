## How to read errors?

If you are somehow stuck in an error and no one is helping in `#discord-bot-help`, Please try to read the errors that the compiler gave for you. For example:

<Callout type="error">**ReferenceError:** "newArray" is not defined</Callout>

<br />

### What went wrong?

There is a non-existent variable referenced somewhere. This variable needs to be declared, or you need to make sure it is available in your current script

<br />

### Example

```diff
- console.log(newArray) // ReferenceError: "newArray" is not defined
```

```diff
+ const newArray = [1, 2, 3]
+ console.log(newArray); // Expected output to be "[1, 2, 3]"
```

<Callout type="error">**TypeError:** Assignment to constant variable.</Callout>

<br />

### What went wrong?

A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program
during normal execution. It cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be
redeclared. In JavaScript, constants are declared using the [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
keyword.

<br />

### Example

Assigning a value to the same constant name in the same block-scope
will throw.

```diff
- const COLUMNS = 80;
- // â€¦
- COLUMNS = 120; // TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'COLUMNS'
```

### Fixing the error

There are multiple options to fix this error. Check what was intended to be achieved with the constant in question.

<br />

### Rename

If you meant to declare another constant, pick another name and re-name. This constant name is already taken in this scope.

```diff
+ const COLUMS = 80;
+ const WIDE_COLUMS = 120;
```

### `const`, `let` or `var`?

Do not use const if you weren't meaning to declare a constant. Maybe you meant to declare a block-scoped variable with [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) or global variable with [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var).

```js
let columns = 80;
// ...
columns = 120;
```

Thank you for taking the time to read this entire thing. - JadeBetty
