## How to ask for help? 

Trying to ask for help in DiscordJS support server, IGP Coding Villa discord-bot-help and general-code-help, and useful-servers provided by DiscordJS Support server would be very hard if you are doing the [ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/). But instead, try to do the things that are listed below: 

<br />

- Learn Basic JS. I have already made a post about learning the basics of JS and NodeJS. [Click me for the link.](/posts/basic-things-to-learn-first)
- Try to read your problem. Try to read and understand your problem as much as you can before asking in IGP Coding Villa discord-bot-help, general-code-help or in others servers such as DiscordJS support server. If you cannot read the compilers code please click the [link](/posts/reading-errors) to understand and read compilers errors. 
- Don't ask basic things such as "How to do I fix this issue? *Sends a syntax error*". Sending a error that can be fixed in seconds or in a minute can waste our helpers time.
- Provide as much details as possible. For example if you are getting a TypeError about something that isn't defined and you don't know what should you define with it. Ask something like "How to I define client in the code listed down below? https://sourceb.in/". 
- Don't you do the things that were listed below :
1. Don't ping or DM (Direct Message) Staff / Moderators or individual members just for help. Send your error in a support channel and wait patiently.
2. Don't put your bot token in the screenshot or your codeblock etc. If you do that your bot will be hacked.
3. Don't spam youe issue. Spamming your issue is violating the support servers rules and you will likely be ignored. So just send your issue and wait patiently.
